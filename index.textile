h1. {{ page.title }}

Welcome to the official gitg homepage!

gitg is a viewer for git repositories. To understand what that means and why that is great you should probably know what "version control":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control is and what "git":http://git-scm.com/ is.

gitg is well integrated with the "GNOME":http://www.gnome.org/ desktop. It is only available for Linux right now.

Depending on your situation you might thus prefer other git clients including: "gitk":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html, "gitx":http://gitx.frim.nl/ and "tortoise":http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/. And then of course there is the trusted command line interface...

  
h1. Features

gitg offers the following features:
* visually browse a git commit log
* do commits (with graphical selection of files to commit)

  
h1. Screenshot
