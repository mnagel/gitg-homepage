Source code can be found in every file/folder except "_site".
For the meaning of the different folders see: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage

The compiled website can be found in "_site".

TODO
- remove / sort out old stuff from mojombo -- this is a copy&paste fork of his work
- fix css so bullet points look better
- improve css so site looks nicer
